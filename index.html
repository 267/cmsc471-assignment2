    <p>For our dataset, we chose to use the Daily Weather in the US for 2017. From this, we pulled the latitude, longitude, elevation, minimum and maximum temperatures, average temperatures, average wind, snow, and precipitation. From this, you are able to choose an X and Y axis from these categories and query by State. While we considered using a U.S. map for our visualization, we realized we both did not have the time nor were we satisfied with what we found in terms of visualizations and how the map itself would look. Using an X/Y graph along with axis labels and animated bubbles with tooltips seemed much more apt and readable. You could view data relative to each other along with seeing insights in terms of average temperature by the color of each data point. These data points are represented as dots, and a tooltip is shown when hovering over that provides weather base station data. Our development process was fluid, we used a Github + Github pages deployment that would automatically redeploy upon a successful push. This made collaboration incredibly easy, along with Visual Studio Codeâ€™s Live Share plugin, which let us all edit code on the same window. We kept in constant contact to make sure no merge conflicts took place and any features added or removed through either in person communication or via a group chat. This assignment roughly took 2.5-3 hours per each of us in terms of setup, brainstorming, programming, and the other such demands of the project. We did not use ChatGPT as a crutch, as we only used it to refresh ourselves on JavaScript concepts, basics, and light debugging along the way.
